🃏 Blackjack Rules (Simplified Version):
1. The goal is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over.
2. Cards 2–10 are worth their face value, face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11.
3. Both the player and dealer start with two cards.
4. The player can choose to:
    Hit: Take another card.
    Stand: Keep current hand and end turn.
5. The dealer must keep drawing cards until reaching 17 or higher.
6. If either the player or dealer exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game.
7. Closest to 21 without going over wins.
