# Go Fish üêü - Card Game Rules

**Objective**: Collect the most books (sets of 4 cards of the same rank).

**Players**: 2 (Human vs Computer)

### Game Rules:
- Players take turns asking the opponent for a specific rank.
- You can only ask for a rank you already have.
- If the opponent has cards of that rank, they must give all of them.
- If not, the opponent says "Go Fish", and you draw one card from the deck.
- If you draw the card you asked for, you get another turn.
- Form a "book" when you collect 4 of the same rank.
- Game ends when all 13 books have been formed.
