🃏 War – Basic Rules
🎯 Objective
To win the most rounds by playing the higher card.

🔧 Setup
A standard 52-card deck is shuffled and evenly divided between two players.
Each player starts with 26 cards, face down.
Cards are ranked in standard order:
2 (lowest) → 10 → J → Q → K → A (highest)

🕹️ Gameplay
In each round, both players draw the top card of their deck and reveal it.
The player with the higher-ranked card wins the round and scores 1 point.
If the cards are of equal value, the round is a tie, and no points are awarded.
The game continues for 26 rounds (since each player has 26 cards).
After all rounds are complete, the player with the most points wins.

🏆 Winning
The player with the highest score after all rounds is declared the winner.
If both players have the same score, the game ends in a draw.
