ðŸ“œ Game Rules for War
Objective: Win all the cards.
Players: 2

Gameplay:
Each player draws the top card from their deck.
The higher card wins the round; the winner takes both cards and places them at the bottom of their deck.
If the cards are equal in value, it's "war":
Each player places one card face down and then one card face up.
The higher face-up card wins all cards.
Repeat war if those cards are also equal.

Endgame:
A player wins when the opponent has no cards left.
